# CryptoPay
A app to pay crypto using Phone Number to make it simplified<br>
<b>Objective: </b><br>
Currently the paying of crypto currencies require Long Wallet address which are of 64 words long and quite hard to remember and if one letter is changed the payment is sent to some other person,we solved this problem using Phone numbers .<br>
<b>Technical Dets :</b> <br>
We have built the product on Polygon Network and have used Metamask for transaction validation and payment .<br>
When the user registers on our app ,an OTP will be sent to his phone number to verify himsef and after verification only he will be able to login.<br>
When the transaction is going to happen Metamask will also verify the wallet address and it's owner <br>
We also have a donating page where you can donate to Organisations which requires funds for their project .<br>
After Login user can easily send payment in crypto to his friend but the necessity is he/she needs to be registered on our app .<br>
A Transaction history page which shows transactions which you hav e performed earlier .<br>
